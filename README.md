## About The Project

![Product Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ankitsahani712006/Bing-Search-Automator-2025/refs/heads/main/Screenshot%202025-06-27%20124312.png)

Manually performing dozens of Bing searches every day to earn Microsoft Rewards points can be tedious and time-consuming. The **PSH MODS Bing Rewards Booster** solves this problem by automating the entire process in a safe, efficient, and intelligent way.

Unlike simpler bots that can put your account at risk, this extension was built with a core focus on mimicking real user activity. It generates millions of unique, natural-language searches, simulates typing character-by-character, scrolls the page, and uses randomized delays between actions. This ensures the automation is virtually indistinguishable from a human, providing peace of mind and protecting your account.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **üíª Automated PC & üì± Mobile Searches**
    * Set it and forget it. The extension runs the full quota of searches required to maximize your daily points for both desktop and mobile platforms.

* **üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Mobile Emulation**
    * This extension goes beyond basic user-agent switching. It uses a robust, two-pronged approach:
        1.  **Network-Level Spoofing:** Uses the `declarativeNetRequest` API to modify the User-Agent header for all network requests.
        2.  **Client-Side Injection:** Injects a script into the page's main JavaScript context to modify `navigator.userAgent`.
    * This dual-layer method is crucial for modern websites and makes the mobile presence far more convincing and secure.

* **ü§ñ Human-like Behavior Simulation**
    * To ensure the highest level of account safety, all automation appears natural:
        * **Massive Query Dictionary:** Generates millions of unique search queries from a huge internal dictionary of words and sentence structures.
        * **Simulated Typing:** Animates the typing of each search term character-by-character into the search bar.
        * **Realistic Delays:** Uses randomized, human-like delays between all major actions.
        * **Page Interaction:** Scrolls the results page up and down after a search, just like a real user.

* **‚å®Ô∏è Full Hotkey Control**
    * Manage searches from any browser tab without ever needing to click the popup icon.
        * **Start PC Search:** `Ctrl+Shift+P`
        * **Start Mobile Search:** `Ctrl+Shift+M`
        * **Stop All Searches:** `Ctrl+Shift+S`

* **üí° Intuitive & Informative UI**
    * The clean popup interface gives you a clear view of the current status, showing which mode is running (`PC` or `Mobile`) and a real-time progress counter (e.g., `15/35`). All buttons are disabled during operation to prevent conflicts.
